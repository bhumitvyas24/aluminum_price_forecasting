Aluminum Price Volatility Forecasting & Hedging for Breweries
This project applies econometric (GARCH) and AI (LSTM) models to forecast aluminum price volatility and design a hedging strategy for breweries that depend on aluminum cans.
It transforms procurement from reactive buying into a predictive, data-driven risk management framework.

**🚀 Key Objectives
Forecast aluminum futures volatility using:**
GARCH(1,1)-t (traditional econometric model)
**LSTM neural network** (deep learning model)
Evaluate models with **MSE, MAE, QLIKE.**
Translate forecasts into hedge ratios for breweries.
Compute hedge needs in LME futures contracts (25-ton lots).
Compare GARCH vs LSTM hedging recommendations.


📊 Workflow
**Data Collection**

Aluminum futures data (ALI=F) fetched from Yahoo Finance.
Daily returns and realized volatility (squared returns) computed.
Modeling

**GARCH(1,1)-t**: captures volatility clustering, conservative, reacts to spikes.
**LSTM:** uses 21-day lookback to predict next-day volatility, smoother and cost-efficient.
Evaluation

**Metrics:** MSE, MAE, QLIKE.
Visualization of actual vs forecasted volatility.
Hedging Strategy

Minimum-variance hedge ratio computed.
Hedge recommendations converted into 25-ton futures lots.
Comparison:
**GARCH **→ more frequent adjustments, higher protection, higher cost.
**LSTM **→ steadier hedging, lower costs, higher exposure risk.
Hybrid approach recommended.
